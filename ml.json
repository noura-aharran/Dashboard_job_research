The position involves the design, synthesis, and characterization of porous materials to control the release of fertilizers into the soil.\n\nThe project aims to develop and optimize innovative porous carriers to enhance fertilizer efficiency, controlled release, and sustainability in agricultural applications. This research will improve nutrient retention, reduce environmental impact, and increase crop yields. In addition, some sensing tests will be accomplished in a water medium, and soil environments, with further evaluations carried out in the presence of crops.\n\nRequired Qualifications\n\nThe candidates must have strong experience in MOF synthesis and characterization with a PhD and demonstrated experience in Materials Science, Materials Chemistry, Inorganic chemistry, catalysis, and related disciplines. He/she should have experience in the formulation of fertilizers and their control during the release.\n\nThe candidate is recommended to demonstrate experience in undertaking independent research, managing research activities of Master and supervising PhD students. Fluency in English as well as a proven ability to write scientific articles are also mandatory. The post-doctoral fellow should be an effective team player to interact constructively with the interdisciplinary team of the CBS department and other collaborators with different backgrounds.\n\nThe Project Requires The Following Skills\n\n\n * Familiarity with fertilizer formulation processes and technologies like, granulation and encapsulation to create specialized fertilizers.\n * Knowledge and understanding of the chemical composition of fertilizers and their interaction with porous materials.\n * Employ various techniques to thoroughly characterize fertilizers, evaluating their chemical composition and physical properties to ensure optimal quality and performance\n * Familiar with the fabrication and characterization of porous materials.\n * Insertion and encapsulation of fertilizers within the porous materials\n * Able to examine the textural and structural changes of porous materials by using a panoply of characterization techniques such as XRD, N2 adsorption, FESEM, TEM, XAS, XPS, dissolution-NMR, IR spectroscopy and TGA and other related spectroscopy techniques such as UV and fluorometer.\n * Skilled in performing sensing tests and evaluating fertilizer release behavior in various media, including aqueous solutions, soil environments, and agricultural setups with growing crops.\n * Ability to interpret experimental results to optimize material design and performance for enhanced fertilizer efficiency and sustainability.\n   \n   \n\nAbout UM6P\n\nLocated at the heart of the future Green City of Benguerir, Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P), a higher education institution with an international standard, is established to serve Morocco and the African continent.
